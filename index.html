	<div> For any of you graphic designers out there, have you ever been in a situation where you wanted to find the 
	perfect color for your project while you were out and about, or maybe when you were away from your computer? 
	You are in luck! The Color Calculator app is here to help you zero in on the perfect colors for you, as well
	as some complementary colors to spice things up even more! </div>

	<div style="font-size:75%;"> This app allows for the user to manipulate RGB sliders to find just the color you are looking for. The app will also tell you
	the hexcode value of the color as you mess around, incase you ever find a color that you might want to come back to. Along with finding a single color, Color Calculator
	has another page that will take a color you make and show the complementary color on the other side!

	<div style="font-size:80%;"> Color Calculator can also help you if you need to find a color using the CMYK color mode.
	CMYK slider manipulation and complements are now available alongside RGB!
